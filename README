This Version of MoLog is incomplete and experimental.

More work needs to be done on: 

	* Implementing REST api
	* Delivering updates to Nagios not implemented yet.

Molog is a Log evaluating framework sitting in between RabbitMQ, Nagios and ElasticSearch.

* A stand alone daemon with configurable parallel workers.
* Consumes and LogStash processes messages from RabbitMQ.
* Evaluates messages and sends updates to Nagios through NSCAweb.
* Regex rules can be applied to the LogStash generated fields.
* Stores references to records in ElasticSearch for logs which generated alerts.
* Forwards and stores all messages into ElasticSearch.
* Provides API for manipulating references and manage matching rules.
