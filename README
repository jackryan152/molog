This Version of MoLog is incomplete and experimental.

More work needs to be done on: 

	* Completing the REST api
	* Web interface which interacts with REST api is missing.

MoLog is a Linux/Unix syslog and Windows eventlog monitoring solution made to work together with a Nagios(tm) Core based monitoring solution.

* A stand alone daemon with builtin REST api.
* Uses as a source a centralized rsyslog/mysql setup using the Monitorware db schema.
* Used MongoDB to store application data.
* Submits results to a file, named pipe, NSCAweb or NRDP.
* Rsyslogd DB is never altered.
* Only submits results passively when matches occur.
* Assign a syslog priority to the monitoring warning or critical alert category.
* Exclude syslog entries from the monitoring warning or critical status using regular expressions.
* Apply regular expressions on a global or per host basis.
* Remove open alerts from the web interface and update monitoring automatically through passive check results.
* MoLog has its own database containing references to the interesting records in the Rsyslogd database.
* Builtin queue which buffers passive check results when they can't be delivered.
