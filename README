                  Wishbone-based

Molog is processing layer for a scalable logging infrastructure which consumes LogStash processed logs from RabbitMQ and 
sends updates to Nagios and ElasticSearch.

Features:

    * Wishbone based
    * Ability to chain named regular expressions.
    * Positive and negative regex matching.


This unfinished version of MoLog is a complete rewrite based upon the Wishbone library.
The motivation of this rewrite is to have cleaner, more modular code and to have more functionality.
