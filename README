This Version of MoLog is incomplete and experimental.

More work needs to be done on: 

	* Implementing REST api
	* Delivering updates to Nagios not implemented yet.

Molog is a framework which consumes and matches logs from RabbitMQ and sends updates to Nagios and ElasticSearch.

* A stand alone daemon with configurable parallel workers.
* Workers consume LogStash processed messages from RabbitMQ and perform negative regex matching on them.
* Regex rules can be applied to all LogStash generated fields.
* Sends Nagios passive check results back to RabbitMQ.
* Forwards and stores all messages into ElasticSearch.
* Stores references of ElasticSearch records into a MongoDB instance.
* Provides API for querying and manipulating references and regexes.
